# Migration script - demonstrates the equivalence between old and new approaches

echo "SBI Deployment Migration Guide"
echo "============================="
echo
echo "OLD (Ansible-based):"
echo "  chmod +x bootstrap-deployment.sh"
echo "  ./bootstrap-deployment.sh v1.2.3"
echo
echo "NEW (Go CLI-based):"
echo "  chmod +x bootstrap-deployment.sh"
echo "  ./bootstrap-deployment.sh v1.2.3"
echo
echo "  Or directly with the Go CLI:"
echo "  go build -o sbi-deploy ."
echo "  ./sbi-deploy --setup          # One-time environment setup"
echo "  ./sbi-deploy --tag=v1.2.3     # Deploy with specific tag"
echo
echo "The bootstrap script has been updated to use the Go CLI internally,"
echo "so the interface remains the same for existing users."
echo
echo "Benefits of the new Go CLI approach:"
echo "✓ No Ansible dependency"
echo "✓ Single binary distribution"
echo "✓ Better error handling and logging"
echo "✓ Faster execution"
echo "✓ Cross-platform compatibility"
echo "✓ Built-in configuration validation"
echo
echo "Configuration remains the same (deployment.conf)."
echo "Environment variables are still supported."
